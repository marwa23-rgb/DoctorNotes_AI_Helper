Automate the extraction of structured clinical data from unstructured medical transcriptions using the OpenAI API, enabling faster, more accurate documentation and diagnosis coding
__________________________________
This project aims to streamline medical documentation by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to transform unstructured clinical narratives into structured, actionable data. By integrating the OpenAI API with Python-based NLP techniques, the system automates the extraction of critical medical information—such as symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments—from natural language transcripts recorded by healthcare professionals during patient encounters.

Manual extraction of such information is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when preparing records for administrative and insurance-related purposes. To address this, the project includes a pipeline that not only extracts relevant data but also performs automated mapping to ICD-10 codes—a globally recognized standard for disease classification and billing.

Technologies and tools used in this project include:

1)OpenAI API for natural language understanding and extraction
2)Python for scripting and integration
3)Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text cleaning and analysis
4)Regular Expressions and Pattern Matching for identifying clinical entities
5)ICD-10 Classification Standards for code assignment

By reducing the administrative burden and enhancing the accuracy of clinical documentation, this solution enables healthcare teams to devote more time to direct patient care and improves the efficiency of healthcare data workflows.
